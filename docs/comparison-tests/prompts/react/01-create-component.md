# React Test 1: Create a Component

## Prompt

```
Create a UserCard React component in TypeScript that displays:
- User avatar (image URL)
- User name
- User email
- User role (admin, user, guest)

Include:
- Props interface
- Loading state
- Error state (when avatar fails to load)
- Unit tests with React Testing Library
```

## Expected Evaluation Points

| Aspect | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| TypeScript | Props interface with proper types |
| States | Loading, error, success states handled |
| Accessibility | Alt text, semantic HTML, ARIA |
| Testing | @testing-library/react, user events |
| Styling | CSS modules, styled-components, or Tailwind |
| Error boundary | Image error handling |
| Props | Optional vs required properly typed |
