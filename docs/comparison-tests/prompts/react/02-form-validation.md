# React Test 2: Form with Validation

## Prompt

```
Create a ContactForm React component in TypeScript with:
- Name field (required, min 2 characters)
- Email field (required, valid email format)
- Message field (required, min 10 characters)
- Submit button

Requirements:
- Show validation errors inline
- Disable submit until form is valid
- Show loading state during submission
- Show success/error message after submission
- Include tests for all validation scenarios
```

## Expected Evaluation Points

| Aspect | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| Form state | Controlled components or form library |
| Validation | Real-time validation, clear error messages |
| UX | Disabled button, loading indicator |
| Accessibility | Labels, error announcements, focus management |
| Testing | Form submission, validation errors, async states |
| Types | Form data interface, validation schema |
